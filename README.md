### **Student Features**:
- **Take Exams**: Students can take available exams and submit their answers.
- **View Results**: Students can view their exam results and grades.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **JDBC**: For database connectivity.
- **SQL Server**: Database for storing user, exam, and question data.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilizes inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation for modularity.

## Future Improvements
- **Password Hashing**: Implement secure password storage using hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
- **Unit Testing**: Add JUnit tests for better code reliability.
- **User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
